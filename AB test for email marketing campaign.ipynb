    "This is a test project using fake data which could be applied on a real time data to study the opening rate of two sample email letter headings to decide on which header is best to use to run an email marketing campaign for a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data used for this purpose is a fake data. However, the idea of this project is to run a test analysis to see how subscribers will respond to two subject titles and then making business decision on which one to use for the final phase of the marketing campaign.\n",

    "This study is to use SQL in analyzing a dataset using SQLite3 to connect the dataset to a blank table within a named SQLite database while the table takes up the content of the dataset ready for further analysis."
