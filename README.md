# A-B-test-for-email-marketing-campaign
This is a sample code describing the performance comparison of two email marketing campaign categories.

The project involves conducting an A/B test on an email marketing campaign by testing two different sample email subject headings to determine which one yields a higher opening rate. The goal is to identify the most effective subject heading that will be used in the final marketing campaign to maximize email open rates and engagement.

This project uses fake data to design a user pattern in understanding the opening rate of two sample email letter headings with the application of mathematics and simple statistics which can be applied to test how two sample email subject headings could perform based on their opening rate for a business' email marketing campaign.
